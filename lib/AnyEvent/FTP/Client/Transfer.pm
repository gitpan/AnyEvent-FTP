=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::FTP::Client::Transfer - Transfer class for asynchronous ftp client

=head1 VERSION

version 0.02

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use AnyEvent::FTP::Client;
 my $client = AnyEvent::FTP::Client;
 $client->connect('ftp://ftp.cpan.org')->cb(sub {
 
   # $upload_transfer and $download_transfer are instances of
   # AnyEvent::FTP::Client::Transfer
   my $upload_transfer = $client->stor('remote_filename.txt', 'content');
   
   my $buffer;
   my $download_transfer = $client->retr('remote_filename.txt', \$buffer);
 
 });

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents a file transfer with a remote server.  Transfers
may be initiated between a remote file name and a local object.  The 
local object may be a regular scalar, reference to a scalar or a file
handle, for details, see the C<stor>, C<stou>, C<appe> and C<retr> 
methods in L<AnyEvent::FTP::Client>.

This documentation covers what you can do with the transfer object once it
has been initiated.

=head1 ROLES

This class consumes these roles:

=over 4

=item *

L<AnyEvent::FTP::Role::Event>

=back

=head1 EVENTS

This class provides these events:

=head2 open

Emitted when the data connection is opened, and passes in as its first argument 
the L<AnyEvent::Handle> instance used to transfer the file.

 $xfer->on_open(sub {
   my($handle) = @_;
   # $handle isa AnyEvent::Handle
 });

=head2 close

Emitted when the transfer is complete, either due to a successful transfer or
the server returned a failure status.  Passes in the final 
L<AnyEvent::FTP::Client::Response> message associated with the transfer.

 $xfer->on_close(sub {
   my($res) = @_;
   # $res isa AnyEvent::FTP::Client::Response
 });

=head2 eof

Emitted when the data connection closes.

 $xfer->on_eof(sub {
   # no args passed in
 });

=head1 METHODS

=head2 cb

Register a callback with the transfer to be executed when the transfer 
successfully completes, or fails. Works exactly like the L<AnyEvent> condition 
variable C<cb> method.

=head2 ready

Returns true if the transfer has completed (either successfully or not).  If true, then it is safe to call
C<recv> to retrieve the response (Some event loops do not support calling C<recv> before there is a message
waiting).

=head2 recv

Retrieve the L<AnyEvent::FTP::Client::Response> object.

=head2 remote_name

For C<STOU> transfers ONLY, this returns the remote file name.
