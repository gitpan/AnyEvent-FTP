=head1 NAME

AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Role::Help - Help role for FTP server

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Create a context:

 package AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Context::EchoContext;
  
 use Moo;
  
 extends 'AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Context';
 with 'AnyEvent::FTP::Server::Role::Help';
  
 # implement the non-existent echo command
 sub help_echo { 'ECHO <SP> text' }
  
 sub cmd_echo
 {
   my($self, $con, $req) = @_;
   $con->send_response(211 => $req->args);
   $self->done;
 }
 
 1;

Start a server with that context:

 % aeftpd --context EchoContext
 ftp://dfzcgohteq:igdcphxled@localhost:59402

Then connect to that server and test the C<HELP> command:

 % telnet localhost 59402
 Trying 127.0.0.1...

the C<HELP> command for you.
